# GinHub 🍸
GinHub is a software that allows users to obtain information about cocktail recipes. If the name of the drink is not present, the user will be able to add new recipes, if she/he wants to. The recipes can be explored or filtered by name, ingredients and preparation step by step. A further functionality makes possible for the final user to insert the ingredients available as input, and to be returned the corresponding recipes as output (i.e. try to insert Gin and Tonic Water and the software will suggest you a ‘gin tonic’ ).
